This is a scheme for shake off the keypad area using ahk.


It can't be annoying when you lift your pam from the surface of the keyboard when you have to search for the home/end/PgUp/PgDn and the numeric digits key.

It's annoying especially in the laptop keyboard, for its compact layout and plain surface.

This project is just a scheme to get rid of the right side of the keyboard while you are coding or writing you LaTeX file, when you will using lots of shortcut keys either in the smart autocompletion or jump from one placeholder to another.


The tex file in the project was initially used to show some schematic diagrams. But it's beyond my ability later. So it's deprecated now and ignore it.
The keymap.ahk file is a script used in autoHotKey, and you will love it.
